# MazeByTheoChambers

This is a 3d Java desktop maze game made by Paul Falstad and refactored by Peter Kemper for use in class. 
My implementation includes a maze generation algorithm and a robot driver to navigate the 3D environment with operational sensors. My classes include BasicRobot.Java, BasicSensor.java, WallFollower.java, Wizard.java, MazeBuilderKruskal.java, and accompanying junit test classes.
